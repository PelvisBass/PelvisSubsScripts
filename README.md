TEMP. This is all going to undergo a massive overhaul as soon as I stop being lazy (lol)

This repo is here for the convinice of keeping all my subtitle scripts in one easy to get place. I mostly just do typesetting
and openings no real orginal translations here.

You are free to use anything here in anyway you want though I would like credit if possible.
